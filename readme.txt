	This project is a menu driven college project 	
	Which shows most of the basic program done in bachelors first semester.

	We are the students from Kist College of information technology, If you want to contribute
	then write your name on contributors.txt before commiting anything.
	
	Use borland C/C++ compiler to run this program , because it is completly done using it 		and most of the pre-built functions are obsolete in other compilers.
	
	Thank you. :)
